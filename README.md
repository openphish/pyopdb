This module lets you integrate the OpenPhish Phishing Database into existing systems and build custom tools. The API module interacts with a local, periodically updated copy of the OpenPhish Database. It also includes a simple command-line interface that allows you to quickly interact with the database for everyday tasks, such as searching for a URL.

In order to use the OPDB API you need to have a valid production or free trial license. Details: https://openphish.com/phishing_database.html
